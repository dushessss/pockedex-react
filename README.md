# Pokedex

This project was made as my homework on course.<br>

To consolidate knowledge about React and fetch.
## I was using:
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).
- [React](https://react.dev/).
- [React-router-dom](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) for routing.
- [PokeApi](https://pokeapi.co/) for detailed info about pokemon.
## About the project
- The home page endlessly scrolls through pictures of Pokemon cards, which when clicked opens an about page with detailed information about the Pokemon.
- On the about page you can also write the name of a Pokemon and it will display information on this Pokemon, you can also change the name of the Pokemon in the address bar and it will also show information on it.
- If there is a mistake in the name of a Pokemon or such a Pokemon does not exist, it shows information about Bulbasaur
